 The World Health Organisation (WHO) published a report that found working more than 55 hours a week
increases the risk of stroke by 35% and heart attack by 17%, and is responsible for the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of people annually. Middle-aged men are most affected, and those in the
Western Pacific and Southeast Asia regions are at the highest risk. WHO is recommending labour
standards to improve workers' health.
   The 2020 US Census revealed a population growth of 7%, with Texas gaining the most, resulting in
two additional seats in the Electoral College. People are increasingly moving to the sunbelt states
of the South, notably Texas and Florida, which have gained seats in the Electoral College. This may
increase Republican Party chances of winning the White House in 2024. California, on the other hand,
has seen its population decrease for the first time ever, resulting in a loss of one Electoral
College seat.
 IBM has created a new computer chip, the N002, that is 50% more powerful and uses 75% less energy
than previous models. It contains 50 billion transistors and is small enough to fit on a fingernail.
It will extend battery life in cell phones, increase speed in datacentres, and help with artificial
intelligence. However, it will take a few years for mass production as there is currently a shortage
of computer chips.
 The Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 caused two deaths and over 30 workers to succumb to
radiation sickness, leading to a discussion on the safety of nuclear energy and the collapse of the
Soviet Union. The site was shut down in 2000 and a sarcophagus was built to prevent further
radiation leaks. Today, the area is still affected by radiation and has become a tourist
destination. The Ukrainian government is now planning to use the area for nuclear waste.
